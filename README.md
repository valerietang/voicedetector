# voicedetector

Welcome to my fun little program where I turn my laptop into a voice detector that plays funny sounds whenever it detects certain keywords! Change the file links to something local on your device and have Vosk en-us-0.15, pygame, and pyaudio installed for it to run on your device. The keywords can be changed as well if desired.
